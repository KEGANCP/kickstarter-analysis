# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Project Overview
Louise's play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short period of time. Now she'd like to view how other campaigns haved fared. Louise is interested in an analysis of prior fundraising effectiveness via Kickstarter. This analysis will breakdown other Kickstarter campaigns in relation to their goals, launch dates, and other relevant criteria.
