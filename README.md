# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Project Overview
Louise's play *Fever* came close to its fundraising goal in a short period of time. Now she'd like to view how other campaigns haved fared. Louise is interested in an analysis of prior fundraising effectiveness via Kickstarter. This analysis will breakdown other Kickstarter campaigns in relation to their goals, launch dates, and other relevant criteria. 
# Analysis & Challenges
Utilizing [raw data of prior Kickstarter campaigns](https://github.com/KEGANCP/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/KICKSTARTER_Challenge.xlsx), totaling in over 4,100 lines, we were able to quantify and analyze the effectiveness of various other campaigns. With this data we were able to determine effectiveness of each campaign based on the specific project, the date, their goals, and the success rate of each to better prepare Louise with data to answer her inquiries.
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The below will provide a visual specific to Theater campaigns and how they fared by launch date. This is important to determine if there is collectively a more effective campaign response based on the time of the year. Using this data we can conclude that May has been the most effective start date, while December has been the least effective. Based on historical data we can conclude our summer months (May-July), are going to be our most effective launch dates.

## Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals
The below will provide a visual on how *successful, failed,* and *canceled* "Theater/Play" Kickstarter campaigns fared based on their funding goals. Using this data we can conclude that Theater campaigns are succesful more frequently when the funding goal is less than $1,000. We can also see that the effectiveness declines as the goal increases to $29,999.

## Challenges
There are various challenges to consider when preparing this information; an example of a difficulty identified when accumulating this data includes breaking down categories that would be specific to Louises' needs. Given that Louise is interested in Kickstarter campaigns relevant to her play *Fever*, a lot of the data within the Kickstarter data set would not be entirely relevant to her. Thankfully, we were able to break this data down by sorting out Theater categories, and even more specific, by Plays.  

# Results

## Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
- Historically May has been the most effective start date for Theater Kickstarter campaigns.
- Historically December  has been the least effeective start date for Theater Kickstarter campaigns.
- We conclude that summer months (May-July) have been the more effective start date for Theater Kickstarter campaigns.

## Outcomes based on Goals
- Theater Kickstarter campaigns are successful more frequently when the funding goal is less than $1,000.
- Theater Kickstarter campaigns historically become less effective as the goal increases to $29,000.

## Limitations
- Louise will not be able to determine specific region based effectiveness of Kickstarter campaigns, based on this dataset.
- This dataset does not provide data beyond 2017.

## Further Potential Analysis
Other helpful tables or graphs that we could generate with this data include:
- How many backers, on average, result in a more successful campaign.
- What average donation quantity results in a more successful campaign.
- We could also determine if a specific time of year results in higher backers & donation averages for Theater Kickstarter campaigns.
