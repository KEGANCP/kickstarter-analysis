# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Project Overview
Louise's play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short period of time. Now she'd like to view how other campaigns haved fared. Louise is interested in an analysis of prior fundraising effectiveness via Kickstarter. This analysis will breakdown other Kickstarter campaigns in relation to their goals, launch dates, and other relevant criteria. 
## Analysis & Challenges
Utilizing [raw data of prior Kickstarter campaigns](https://github.com/KEGANCP/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/KICKSTARTER_Challenge.xlsx), totaling in over 4,100 lines, we were able to quantify and analyze the effectiveness of various other campaigns. With this data we were able to determine effectiveness of each campaign based on the specific project, the date, their goals, and the success rate of each to better prepare Louise with data to answer her inquiries.
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The below will provide a visual specific for Theater campaigns and how they fared by launch date. This is important to determine if there is collectively a more effective campaign response based on the time of the year. Using this data we can conclude that May has been the most effective start date, while December has been the least effective. Based on historical data we can conclude our summer months (May-July), are going to be our most effective launch dates.
